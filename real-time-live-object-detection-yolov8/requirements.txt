# Real-Time and Image-Based Object Detection using YOLOv8 (Flask Web App)

This is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to:
- Detect objects in uploaded images using YOLOv8
- Detect objects in real-time using webcam feed
- View detection results directly in the browser

## 📦 Requirements

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if you want to install them manually:

```bash
pip install Flask==2.2.5
pip install ultralytics==8.0.205
pip install opencv-python==4.9.0.80
```

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

## 🖼 Image Detection

- Upload one or multiple `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.
- Model performs detection and saves results.
- View results on `result.html`

## 🎥 Real-Time Detection

- Click on the **Live Detection** button
- Real-time annotated video stream appears in browser

## 📝 Notes

- Uses YOLOv8s model (`yolov8s.pt`) for detection.
- Change the model in `app.py` if needed (`YOLO('best.pt')`).
